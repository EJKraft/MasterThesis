    "Since we have float data and chi² needs integer data, such as observation counts, we have to convert our data. To illustrate how this is done, we'll look at a specific emotion, 'Anger'. We need to make sure that in our observation count, we do not have any cells with a value of less than 5, since this yields errors and may falsify the result. So we calculate the quantiles of our emotion 'Anger', which yields us three thresholds to compare the float data. This way, we can count how many samples were in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th Quantile. We want to compare two (or more) groups, so we compare only the female values and sort them into quartiles, then for male values. This yields a 2x4 table. An example table is printed below. This table is used to calculate the chi2 statistic. Note that the function 'calcFrequencyTable' takes in a pd.DataFrame, not a pd.Series and returns an array of pd.DataFrames. This means, that the function calculates these tables for all different emotions defined in e.g. emotion_label."

Looking at the standardized residuals, we see that for anger females tend to have higher values (4th Quartile ~2.60) than males (1st Quartile ~1.81). Looking at boredom, we see that females tend to have higher values (4th quartile ~2.94) than males (1st Quartile 1.81). Regarding disgust, we see that females tend to have higher values (4th quartile 3.95) than males (1st quartile 3.85). Looking at fear, we see that females have higher values (4th quartile 3.61), but males also have values greater than the median (3rd quartile ~2.04). Also, males have lower values (1st quartile ~1.47), so we can say that females have higher values of fear when asking a question. Regarding happiness, we see that females have only one positive value in the 4th quartile (~3.28), so we can say, that females tend to have a happier voice when asking questions than males. Lastly, if we take a look at the residuals of sadness, we see that females have lower values (1st quartile 4.63 for female), than males (3rd quartile ~1.70; 4th quartile ~3.17), so we can say that males tend to be more sad when asking a question.\n",

Regarding nervousness, we see that males tend to be more nervous when asking a question (4th quartile ~2.49) than females (1st quartile ~2.94). Looking at the residuals of tiredness, we see that males tend to be more tired than females. The differences lie between 1st, 2nd and 3rd quartile, where females have a value of ~3.61 for the 1st quartile and males have values of ~2.16 and ~1.02 for the 2nd and 3rd quartile.\n",

    "If we have a look at the p-values for arousal valence, we see that females and males differ significantly regarding arousal. Further looking at the residuals, we see that females tend to have higher arousal values than males (3rd and 4th quartile positive for females; 1st and 2nd quartile positive for males).\n",

Looking at high interest we see that females have more values within the 4th quartile (~2.60) and males have more values within the 3rd quartile (~2.04).\n",
