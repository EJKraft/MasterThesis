    "Since we have float data and chi² needs integer data, such as observation counts, we have to convert our data. To illustrate how this is done, we'll look at a specific emotion, 'Anger'. We need to make sure that in our observation count, we do not have any cells with a value of less than 5, since this yields errors and may falsify the result. So we calculate the quantiles of our emotion 'Anger', which yields us three thresholds to compare the float data. This way, we can count how many samples were in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th Quantile. We want to compare two (or more) groups, so we compare only the female values and sort them into quartiles, then for male values. This yields a 2x4 table. An example table is printed below. This table is used to calculate the chi2 statistic. Note that the function 'calcFrequencyTable' takes in a pd.DataFrame, not a pd.Series and returns an array of pd.DataFrames. This means, that the function calculates these tables for all different emotions defined in e.g. emotion_label."

    "If we take a look at the above p-values, we see significant differences in emotion for disgust, fear and sadness. Regarding the residuals, we see that females are more disgusted than males (4th quartile ~6.25), 1st and 2nd quartile for males: ~4.70 and ~2.03. Further looking at fear, we see that females tend to have more 'extreme' values, meaning that the 1st quartile and 4th quartile are positive (~2.11 and ~0.92). Looking at sadness, we see that (just as in the previous analysis) males tend to be more sad than females (3rd quartile ~1.3, 4th quartile ~4.70).\n",

    "Looking at the p-values of affect, we can see significant difference for aggressive, cheerful, intoxicated and tired. Further analyzing the residuals, we can see that females tend to be more aggressive (4th quartile ~4.18) than males (1st quartile ~3.51, 2nd quartile ~1.44). Looking at cheerful we see that males tend to have higher values (4th quartile ~3.51) than females (1st to 3rd quartile positive). Regarding intoxication, we see that females tend to have values above the median (3rd and 4th quartile positive (~1.68 and ~2.70), while males tend to have values below the median (1st quartile ~2.92, 2nd quartile ~1.44). Lastly looking at tiredness, we see that males tend to be more tired than females, as males have positive values for the 3rd and 4th quartile, and females have positive values for the 1st and 2nd quartile.\n",

    "If we take a look at the p-values for arousal valence, we see arousal and valence show significant differences between males and females. Looking at the residuals, we can see that females have higher values of arousal than males (1st quartile for males ~6.18, 3rd Q for females ~2.27 and 4th Q for females ~3.59). Regarding valence, we see that females tend to have values below the median (positive values for 1st Q ~3.88 and 2nd Q ~1.22), whereas males tend to have values above the median (3rd Q ~3.68; 4th Q ~1.44).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly if we take a look at the p-values for level of interest, we can see significant differences for disinterest, normal and high interest. Further investigating the residuals tells us, that females tend to have lower values for disinterest than males (1st quartile ~3.88 for females). Furthermore females tend to have lower values for normal interest than males (1st quartile ~3.29 for females). This implies, that females will have higher values for high interest. By looking at the residuals we are able to confirm this: the only positive value for females is at the 4th quartile (~3.29).\n",
