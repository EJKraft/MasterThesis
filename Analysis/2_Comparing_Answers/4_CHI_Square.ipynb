    "Since we have float data and chi² needs integer data, such as observation counts, we have to convert our data. To illustrate how this is done, we'll look at a specific emotion, 'Anger'. We need to make sure that in our observation count, we do not have any cells with a value of less than 5, since this yields errors and may falsify the result. So we calculate the quantiles of our emotion 'Anger', which yields us three thresholds to compare the float data. This way, we can count how many samples were in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th Quantile. We want to compare two (or more) groups, so we compare only the female values and sort them into quartiles, then for male values. This yields a 2x4 table. An example table is printed below. This table is used to calculate the chi2 statistic. Note that the function 'calcFrequencyTable' takes in a pd.DataFrame, not a pd.Series and returns an array of pd.DataFrames. This means, that the function calculates these tables for all different emotions defined in e.g. emotion_label."
