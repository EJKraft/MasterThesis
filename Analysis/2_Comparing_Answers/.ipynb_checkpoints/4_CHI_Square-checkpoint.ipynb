    "Since we have float data and chi² needs integer data, such as observation counts, we have to convert our data. To illustrate how this is done, we'll look at a specific emotion, 'Anger'. We need to make sure that in our observation count, we do not have any cells with a value of less than 5, since this yields errors and may falsify the result. So we calculate the quantiles of our emotion 'Anger', which yields us three thresholds to compare the float data. This way, we can count how many samples were in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th Quantile. We want to compare two (or more) groups, so we compare only the female values and sort them into quartiles, then for male values. This yields a 2x4 table. An example table is printed below. This table is used to calculate the chi2 statistic. Note that the function 'calcFrequencyTable' takes in a pd.DataFrame, not a pd.Series and returns an array of pd.DataFrames. This means, that the function calculates these tables for all different emotions defined in e.g. emotion_label."

Regarding disgust we see that females tend to have values above the median (positive values in the 3rd and 4th Quartile) whereas males tend to have values below the median (positive values in 1st and 2nd Quartile). Looking at fear we see that females tend to have lower values (~3.11 in 1st Quartile) while males have a value of ~1.37 for the 2nd Quartile and ~2.04 for the 3rd Quartile, the 4th quartile does not show great differences. This means, that men tend to have more values around the median than females. Looking at neutral (emotion) we can see that males and females only differ between the 1st and 2nd quartile (female 1st quartile ~3.1; male 2nd quartile ~2.7). Regarding sadness, we see that females and males differ in the extremes: females have a value of ~4.10 for the 1st quartile whereas males have a value of ~4.04 for the 4th quartile. This implies that females tend to have lower values for sadness than males.\n",

Regarding aggressive, we see that males tend to have lower values (1st quartile ~4.17 for males) than females (4th quartile ~4.62 for females). Looking at cheerful, we see that females tend to have lower values than males, since the value for the 4th quartile for males is ~4.04, whereas the values for females for the 2nd and 3rd quartile are ~2.96 and ~1.62. Regarding intoxication we are able to see that females tend to have higher values (3rd quartile and 4th quartile positive), whereas males have lower intoxication values (1st quartile ~4.84). Regarding tiredness, we see the most differences in the 1st and 4th quartile: males have higher values for tiredness (4th quartile ~3.71) than females (1st quartile ~3.44).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also for Arousal-Valence, we can say that the populations differ in arousal significantly. Looking at the residuals we see that females tend to have higher values than males (only 1st quartile is positive for males ~5.50).\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding Level of Interest, we only see a statistic significant difference in disinterest. Regarding the residuals we see that females have lower values (1st and 2nd Quartile positive) for disinterest than males.\n",
